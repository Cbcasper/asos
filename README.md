# Asos

This is the repository for the asos project in my internship for TEXTUA. Here some jupyter notebooks were created to work with the data provided by the client.

### `asos-v1.xlsx`
This excel file contains the initial dataframe provided by the client.

### `asos-v2.xlsx`
After experimenting with the data, we returned the feedback to the client, who adapted the data.

### `dataset.ipynb`
Started notebook to load in the data.

### `sentiment-v1.ipynb`
Sentiment analysis for the first dataframe.

### `sentiment-v2.ipynb`
Sentiment analysis for the updated dataframe.

### `multilabel.ipynb`
Multilabel classification for the first dataframe.

### `separate-multilabel.txt`
Results of running the binary classification for every category separately in the form of sklearn classification results.
